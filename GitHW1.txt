I am interested in in taking Intro to Data Science because I am interested in applying the skills I learn in this class to my data science and machine learning projects. We are in an era where data is superior in all aspects of life, such as in machine learning, optimization, and business. As the data science field expands in the future, we will see an increase in an importance of data, so I would like to develop my data science skills to prepare.
